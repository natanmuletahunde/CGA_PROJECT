# Arcade Games Collection

This project is a collection of three simple arcade games implemented in JavaScript using the P5.js library. The games are:

1. **Snake Game**
2. **Ball Game**
3. **Maze Game**

## Overview

The project provides an interactive menu that allows the player to choose between three different games. Each game has its own set of rules and gameplay mechanics, as listed below:

### 1. Snake Game

-   The player controls a green snake that moves around the screen.
-   The goal is to collect food (represented by an apple), which makes the snake grow longer.
-   The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.

### 2. Ball Game

-   The player controls a paddle (the "handle") that can be moved left or right.
-   A ball bounces off the paddle, and the player must keep the ball from falling off the screen.
-   The ball will destroy blocks when it touches them, and the player earns points for each block destroyed.
-   The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle.

### 3. Maze Game

-   The player controls a blue player sprite and navigates through a maze.
-   The goal is to reach the green exit without touching any walls.
-   Each time the player reaches the exit, they gain points and the maze is reset.

## Features
